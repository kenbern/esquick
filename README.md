# esquick

** DEMO

This is demonstration code. The code is converted to typescript code from my private non open source code.

The code demonstrates an alternative solution for parsing JavaScript code

What it does

* No ast needed
* Pretty printing identical to Prettier
* Dead code elimination 
* minify ala Terser
* linter aka EsLint with plugin support 
* Handle comments

It's build for high performance using a fragment approach.

Original code exist in Assembly and C language 

I have no time to open source this code completely. There are many other tools that serve the same performance.

Maybe in the future I can open source all my code if any interest in the already proven examples.
